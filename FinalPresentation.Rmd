$\mu:$ Average miles driven a year
$H_0:\mu1=\mu2$ vs $H_a:\mu1<\mu2$
```{r}
avg_mi_US_per_day=13476/365

t.test(miles_driven$MilesDriven,mu=avg_mi_US_per_day,alternative='less')
```
P-value is 5.185e-06 which is less than the s.1.
Therefore we reject the $H_0$. At $5\%$ s.1. data does provide enough evidence to conclude that mean miles driven by me is less than the US average.

```{r}
ggplot(data=miles_driven,aes(x=Day,y=MilesDriven))+geom_line()+geom_line(y=avg_mi_US_per_day,color='red')+ylim(c(0,45))
  
```
